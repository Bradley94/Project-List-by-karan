# Project-List-by-karan
WIP using a list of projects from https://github.com/karan/Projects, updated as I go along until the entire list is hopefully completed. 

Structure of the solution is a bit inelegant and clunky but I wanted to be able to keep the entire project in one solution without ending up with an excessive number of files.
The project is thus split up into classes for each section of the project list and each section's challenges are individual functions.
